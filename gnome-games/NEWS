==============
Version 3.25.4
==============

* The way the games collection is built has been completely reworked to
  replace the GameSource types generating Game objects from any way of
  the implementation's choice by the trio of UriSource, UriGameFactory
  and GameCollection. UriSource generate URIs from any way of the
  implementation's choice, UriGameFactory generate Game objects from
  URIs and GameCollection acting as a glue between the two. This new
  flexibility in the creation of the games collection helped to simplify
  the way many game types were defined and helped to introduce new game
  sources to the collection.

* Game URIs can now be passed as command line arguments, allowing your
  game files to be opened with Games from your file manager. The game
  will be automatically started by doing so.

* Add a "Add game files" button to the collection view, allowing you to
  add game files from the collection view to the collection.

* Game resources passed via the command line or the "Add game files"
  button are stored in a database and restored when starting the
  application. This allows Games to see your games even if its game
  resources detection mechanisms failed.

* Introduction of RetroSimpleType to replace many very similar plugins
  by this simple and easier to maintain generic implementation of the
  Libretro based game types.

* Supported games:
 - Add support for Atari Lynx, MS-DOS, WonderSwan and WonderSwan Color
   games.
 - Improve the detection of PlayStation discs by parsing them as an
   emulator would instead of using lucky guessing the location of the
   required information in the disc.
 - Don't display desktop games setting the NoDisplay or Hidden keys.

* Gamepad:
 - Port the gamepad handling system from Vala to C to avoid using Vala's
   preprocessor as it is poorly handled by the autotools, resulting in
   broken tarballs.
 - Make gamepads send events similar to GdkEvent.
 - Replace the custom input types by the Linux event codes.

* UI:
 - Use the more appropriate GtkMessageDialog instead of GtkDialog for
   most of the existing custom dialogs.
 - Refine the look of MediaSelector, using checkmarks to denote the
   currently used media.
 - Use theme relative colors for the games collection.
 - Drop a useless sorting invalidation in CollectionIconView, which
   makes the game collection loads a bit faster.

* Improved logging of the Libretro cores by using the Core.log() signal
  with the retro_g_log() function which have been introduced in
  retro-gtk recently. This will log messages from the Libretro core with
  the core's name as the log domain instead of GNOME Games.

* Improve the parameters passed to the grep command to avoid injections.

* Bump retro-gtk to 0.12.

* Bump tracker-sparql to 2.0.

* Bugs fixed:
 782952 Using grep in Games do not work with a filename --ignore-case
